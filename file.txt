Does the Black Moon howl?
No, but the sparrow's call is sweet.
Yes, but only in winter.
Only when waning.
YES. THE BLACK MOON HOWLS AND ITS BAYING DRAWS FORTH THE HOUNDS OF THE END ALL SHALL BURN IN THE BLACK FIRES OF THE DJOK TOURAFF
No. The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
Only to startle the Sun.
Actually, it's more of a low-pitched, wheezing kind of short mumble, like, do tapirs make any noises? - It's a tapir sneeze.
It never stopped the sun from smiling. She wore a smile to rival its brightness before her beloved passed into the Duat, but her heart grew heavy and hardened. She deserves another chance to say goodbye, just as you gave her another chance.
Black Moon howls in mourning for lost children as the survivors arm themselves for war. The Black Moon sings in remembrance of those lost in forgotten wars.
Only to wake the void
